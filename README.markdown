**tweetlinkr** fetches a user timeline from Twitter looking for tweets with links.

## Usage

./tweetlinkr the_twitter_user_you_want

Will print any tweets from that user containing a link.

## Dependencies

Requires [Net::Twitter](http://search.cpan.org/~mmims/Net-Twitter-3.13008/) which is a rather hefty install because it relies on Moose.
