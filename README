tweetlinkr - find tweets with links
-----------------------------------

tweetlinkr is a Perl program that fetches a user's timeline from twitter,
examines them for links, and prints the tweet to screen if any are found.


Installation
------------

Copy the tweetlinkr program to a directory of your choice.

You'll need the Net::Twitter and File::HomeDir modules installed, all
available from the CPAN.

Usage
-----

./tweetlinkr user

Where 'user' is the screen name of the user whose timeline you wish to fetch.

Configuration & OAuth
---------------------

Starting August 2010, twitter no longer allows basic auth and forces OAuth.
tweetlinkr already has the necessary app consumer_key and consumer_secret but
still requires an access_token and access_token_secret.

On first run, tweetlinkr will attempt to authorize with twitter to obtain
those token values.  It does this in a couple of steps:

- prints the twitter auth URL to screen, you will have to visit that URL
  in your browser.

- twitter will ask to authorize tweetlinkr, if you choose yes, you will be
  given PIN number.  You must give that PIN number to tweetlinkr.

- tweetlinkr will then, using the PIN number, obtain the necessary access_token
  and access_token_secret from twitter and store those to a file for all future
  runs.

tweetlinkr stores the access tokens in ~/.accesstokens
