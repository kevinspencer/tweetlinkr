tweetlinkr - find tweets with links
-----------------------------------

tweetlinkr is a Perl program that fetches a user's timeline from twitter,
examines them for links, and prints the tweet to screen if any are found.


Installation
------------

Copy the tweetlinkr program to a directory of your choice.

You'll need the Net::Twitter and File::HomeDir modules installed, all
available from the CPAN.  Note: Net::Twitter will take some time to install
because of the Moose dependency.

Usage
-----

./tweetlinkr user

Where 'user' is the screen name of the user whose timeline you wish to fetch.
